Starting from the Fake Store API build a mobile-first e-commerce frontend. Use the endpoints to create the following functionalities.

    Create mockups for your app (Mobile & Desktop)
    Build a view to list all the products
    Build a view to display a single product
    Build a cart system
    Build a user profile view

## Backend Objectives

Your goal as a backend developer will be to replicate the Fake Store API endpoints by using a database.

    Create a database that contains Products, Carts and User
    Allow anyone to fetch the list of products
    Allow logged users to add products to their cart
    Create a special role "admin" in the User table
    Create a product management system so that "admin users" can add/edit/delete new products
